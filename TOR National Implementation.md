# Sample Terms of Reference

The TOR can be further specified if national details are known, e.g. about the NDC management tool.
These work steps can also be integrated with larger TORs, especially TORs covering wider NDC management / transparency. Below are sample phrases that may be used. Generally a vendor (firm) or a group of individual consultant are encouraged, as the required skills vary.

## 1. Installation

The following work steps are suggested for the national implementation of the DPG carbon registry in any country.

* Installation of a Carbon Registry from <https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry>
* Technical timeline/roadmap
* Fork the [Carbon Registry](https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry). Send pull requests to `staging` for added features (languages, security patches, modules, etc.).

* Initial Setup of the Carbon Registry, including localization to national requirements:
  * translation of text into relevant national languages
  * adjust colors, logos, maps, etc. to national standard
  * design graphics
  * purchase domain, hosting, & security certificate
  * register & connect supporting services (analytics, forms, etc.)
  * adjust sectors to match the sectors specified in the nationally determined contribution
  * adjust maps to match local regions
  * adjust to local regulatory & legal requirements
  * integration with existing NDC management tools (if applicable) [API]
  * adjustment of user types to national requirements
  * creation of government accounts
  * status page for monitoring uptime, utilizing <https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry-status>
  * *(Deliverable: Fully localized Carbon Registry running on staging (test) environment & productive (live) environment)*
* Build carbon credit calculators for locally-determined sectors & according to local regulations. Referencing <https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry/tree/main/libs/carbon-credit-calculator> . Push new calculators to main codebase.
* [Optional] Creation of new features / modules. Reporting update on <https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry/tree/main/modules>.
* Successful end-to-end test of the registry. This test needs to cover the full lifecycle of one dummy project including at least project creation, authorization, implementation, MRV, issuance and transfer. *(Deliverable: Test Report)*
* Creation of a nationally appropriate sign up procedure for non-government accounts
* Hand over to official government use *(Deliverable: Government Acceptance. Source code submission (ideally on `GitHub`) approved.)*
* Testing: Security, Privacy, Accessibility, Performance, Load. *(Deliverable: 3rd party and/or automated tests.)*
* Ticketing system: For submitting, tracking, & responding to platform requests & bugs.
* Warranty: Supporting long term web hosting and operation (DevOps) of the registry
* Training: interactive tutorial. manual. video/screen recording walkthrough. guidebook. workshops. help page. chatbot.
* Awareness: advertising. community outreach.

  * Functional tests: Automated scripts
  * Performance test: Internal
  * Interface test: User-based. (Including browser compatibility testing on Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari for desktop, mobile and tablet including Windows 10+, MacOS, Android 9+ and iOS alongside responsive web design/screen size checking for 480px, >768px, >992px and >1200px, which covers Phones, Tablets, Desktops and Wide Screens)
* Code Package: Access rights to online git (Github, Gitlab, etc) code repository OR bundled in following file types: .git or .zip containing the full repository of files (such as .yml, .md, .sql, .json, .ts, .html, .svg, .js, etc. ). The latter can be shared via online file sharing services ([Send](https://send.vis.ee), Dropbox, Sharepoint, WeTransfer, etc) as the files will be too large to attach directly in email.

Other items to consider:

* Hosting / cloud server:
  * The ToR is based on the assumption that the government entity has or will prepare a hosting environment in a cloud server. If the government does not have a server space, consider if the vendor will need to host the registry. If so, consider if the vendor can be contracted for a long term.
  * Server specifications: TBD
