    "aboutusline1":"This is a demo of the Standard National Carbon Registry, developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The module is an open-source Digital Public Good, designed in accordance to UNFCCC guidance, based on lessons learnt through UNDP’s Climate Promise and technical expertise of Digital For Climate (D4C) working group members. The ‘ready to install’, yet customizable registry will enable countries to prepare a carbon registry following national contexts, allowing for utilization across various mitigation activities and programs, sectors, and national circumstances while tracking issued carbon credits and enabling credit transfers in an efficient and transparent manner.",
    "aboutusline2":"Interoperability: The carbon registry codebase will continuously improve on system interoperability between national carbon registries and related international systems through the D4C working group. An end to end digital ecosystem will avoid double counting and enable smooth credit transfer. Digitized carbon methodologies: The system will support countries to comply with reporting requirements of the Paris Agreement, by defining calculation methodologies according to the UNFCCC-CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) methodologies across nationally defined sectors. Credit Accounting: A serial number is assigned to each verified offset credit. When a credit is sold, the serial number for the reduction is transferred from the account of the seller to the account of the buyer which reduces the risk of double counting and offers transparency even in case of a cooperative approach of Article 6. Serial number generation is based on the UNFCCC-CDM methodology. Immutable blockchain technology: The immutable blockchain technology will prevent tampering of actions taken on projects and credit information, increasing accountability and credibility of the system.",
