                <u>Verification process</u>
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you
                are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These
                verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can
                match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending
                on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
                that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have
                on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
                that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods
                as the circumstances dictate.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your
                identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid
                requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification.
                However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained
                by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
                verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will
                delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

                  You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your

                  the CCPA.

                  You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to
                  third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as
                  soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of
                  the request submission.
