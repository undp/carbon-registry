## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions. This platform provides an excellent medium for interfacing with the project's development team and other stakeholders who share an interest in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_ guidance below.

## Changing the code-base

As a general guideline, it is recommended to fork this repository, make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull request. All new code should have associated unit tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.

Moreover, the modified code should conform to any stylistic and architectural standards set by the project. In scenarios where such directives are not explicitly stated, strive to emulate the styles and patterns observed in the existing code-base.
